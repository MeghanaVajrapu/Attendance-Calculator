# Attendance-Calculator
The Attendance Calculator Application is a web-based tool for students to track attendance. By entering total classes and days attended, it calculates the current attendance percentage and provides insights on days needed to reach 75% or days that can be missed while maintaining it.
- Implemented dynamic input fields to capture total days and days attended, calculating the real-time attendance percentage.
- Designed logic to calculate additional days required to reach 75% attendance or days permissible for leave while maintaining 75% attendance.
- Created a responsive UI with visual feedback for attendance status, optimizing for user experience across devices.
- Applied URL query parameters to pass data between pages and display customized results based on individual input.
